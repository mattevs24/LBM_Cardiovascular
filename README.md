Exploration of Lattice Boltzmann Methods into the Dynamics of the Cardiovascular System

This is work into the exploration of the cardiovascular system using Lattice Boltzmann Methods (LBM).

The idea behind this is to use the mesoscopic properties of the LBM to explore the flow of blood as well as other particles in the cardiovascular system to start to build models to study particle deposition and various hematologic diseases.
